<h1>How to show user's content on a user's profile page</h1>

<p>Views does this out of the box.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a view of whatever content it is that you want to expose and make it a block.</li>

<li>Then, in the advanced (right) side add a <u>Contextual Filter</u> of the type "Content: Author uid" . The settings are a little complicated. 
  <ul>
    <li>The filter will tell you that you must add a default value:<br/>
    <em>"This display does not have a source for contextual filters, so no contextual filter value will be available unless you select 'Provide default'."</em></li>
    <li>So below where it says: "When the filter value is NOT available" click the radio button that says "provide default value" and from the drop down list select User ID from URL.</li>
    <li>Under "When the filter value IS available or a default is provided" select: "Specify validation criteria"</li>
    <li>the Validator will be: "User"</li>
    <li>check the radio button for: "Allow both numeric UIDs and string usernames"</li>
    <li>Under: "Action to take if filter value does not validate" select: "Hide view".</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>SAVE YOUR VIEW, YOU'RE DONE WITH THE VIEW</h3>

<p>Go to Blocks and configure the block so that it shows in the region you want it to show up in and set it to Show block on specific pages -> Only the listed pages:<br/>
user<br/>
user/*<br/>
users/*<br/>
<p>

<h3>NOW YOU'RE DONE, GO ENJOY YOUR RESULTS. </h3>
